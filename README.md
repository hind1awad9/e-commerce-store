# E-Commerce Application Sample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.5.

## Summary

Welcome to our e-commerce store! Our store has a simple yet efficient design that allows for easy navigation and a seamless shopping experience.

To get started, you'll need to log in on our authentication page. Once you're authenticated, you'll be directed to our product page, where you can browse through a wide variety of products. We understand that our customers may have specific preferences, so we've implemented a filtering system that lets you narrow down your search by categories

If you're an admin user, you'll have access to a separate page where you can manage the products in our store. This page has all the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing you to add new products, update existing ones, remove products that are no longer available, and view all the products currently in our inventory.

Our System amazingly support RTL / LTR with responsive pages
